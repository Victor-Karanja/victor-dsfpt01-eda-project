## Project Overview

I used exploratory data analysis to generate insights for Microsoft on the genre to stock on their movie studio as well as the major factors to be considered inorder to be at the top of the competition.

### Business Problem

Microsoft have decided to create a new movie studio and I will be exploring the types of films that are currently doing the best at the box office, immdb and moviedb and giving resonable insights on the type of genre to stock and some of the factors to be on the look out for.

# Data Understanding and Preparation

Using the data containing the performance of various movies in different genres within a duration of 8 years, I draw insights on the various factors affecting gross,foreign incomes, popularity and ratings.

# The Data

The data used is sourced from the following links.
* [TheMovieDB](https://www.themoviedb.org/)
* [Box Office Mojo](https://www.boxofficemojo.com/)
* [IMDB](https://www.imdb.com/)
* [The Numbers](https://www.the-numbers.com/)

# Results
In my analysis, some of the visualisations representing the relation of data as as shown below:

 The visual above relates the average rating and the popularity of the data for each genre since 2010 to 2018.

 The graph shows the popularity performance of the various genres since 2010

 The chart gives the relationship or the effect of having original titles on the popularity of each genre.

# Conclusion

1. The common genres in the top 5 list of ratings above 8 and popularity include:
    * Action
    * Drama
    * Adventure
    * Crime
    * Comedy

2. Popularity has a positive correlation with the numvotes because the numvotes describes the number of people who gave a rating, an increase in the number of people giving the rating means an increase in the popularity of the movie.

3. An increase in the popularity resulted in an increase in the the gross income raised from the movie. An increase in the gross income raised from a movie increases the profit earned.

4. The originality of the title had a negligible correlation with the popularity.

5. Popularity have a positive correlation coefficient with the production budget. Since the production budget entails the cost of releasing the movie to the public, if one increases the advertisements and the quality of the videos from the movies, the popularity will definitely raise as seen in the analysis

# Recommendation

* I would recommend that Microsoft studio should venture into the comedy,drama,adventure and action genres for having the highest rating and being among the top 5 genres with a high popularity.

* Microsoft should concentrate on having very quality video movies since an increase in the production cost which would be as a result of the inputs done into the creation of the movie resulted to an increase in the domestic gross, foreign gross, popularity and average rating of the movie.

* Changing the title of a movie has a very low correlation to the popularity of the movie. This is because on comparing the genres that had titles changed, only 33% had a higher popularity than movies in the same genre with original titles.

* Microsoft should also venture in running ads and other advertisement medias to increase the popularity of the movies on their movie studio. Ensuring that they provide a good system of movie recommendation to their viewers would have them at the top of the studios.
